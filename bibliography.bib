  abstract = {Due to the variety of technical equipments and terminal layouts, research has produced a multitude of optimization models for seaside operations planning in container terminals. To provide a support in modeling problem characteristics and in suggesting applicable algorithms this paper reviews the relevant literature. For this purpose new classification schemes for berth allocation problems and quay crane scheduling problems are developed. Particular focus is put on integrated solution approaches which receive increasing importance for the terminal management.}

  abstract = {Singapore has one of the busiest ports in the world. Berth planning is one of the problems faced by planners. This paper studies the berth planning problem. We first formulate the problem and show that it is NP-Complete. We transform the berthing problem to a restricted form of the two-dimensional packing problem, use a graph theoretical representation to capture the problem succinctly, and propose an effective heuristic for the problem. Experimental results show that our heuristic performs well on historical test data.}
